    <p>Hi! My name is Shain Dholakiya and I am 19 years old. I was born in Rome, GA and went to Berry College
      Elementary School. My parents are from India and know very little English which is why I am fluent in Gujarati
      and Hindi.
      My brother is 23 years old and works as an IOS Developer in Chicago. He went to college for two years and dropped
      out. He did three coding bootcamps, one of which was called Mobile Makers, and got a job through one of his
      mentors.
      He got into coding when he was about 18 buying and selling things like phones, laptops, and game consoles on
      Amazon. He wanted to make his own website, but didn't want to pay anyone to do it, so he learned how on his own.
      <br>I am a sophmore at Georgia State University majoring in Computer Science. I'm currently enrolled in the
      Georgia Tech Full Stack Flex Coding Bootcamp and excited to see where it takes me. My hobbies include working out
      and playing flag football.</p>
